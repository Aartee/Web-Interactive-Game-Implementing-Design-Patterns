# XP Values Journal

This document has been created to maintain a weekly journal entry to ensure that the Agile XP values are preserved during the implementation of this project.

## Week 1:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

Anything we create or develop is useful only if its understandable to everyone. Simplicity is hence key to all implementations. Complex thoughts and ideas can be broken into small units and simplified and implemented. This makes the content easy and comprehensive to interpret. 

This is the first week of the project and we have just begun discussing on the roles, task of each member, responsibilities, the technologies that can be used, alternate solutions, design and architecture and others. Whatever the idea may be, we shall put in effort to keep each unit simple and easy to interpret. 

The unnecessary elements need to be removed so that the necessary elements of the work get highlighted which involves the ability to simplify them. Simplicity leads to greater appreciation since it helps us to reduce the problem and uncover an innovation solution.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

The best way to eliminate waste is to do what is being asked and not more than that. Right from the starting our priority was to discard unwanted features and processes.

During the first week, we used the knowledge that was available within the team members and tried not to reinvent the wheel. We shared knowledge throughout the week in our meetings and Meeting Minutes were documented. We also created the task board and mentioned the backlog items.

We discussed to use open-source game engine as the aim of this project is to explore how Design patterns apply to project thus eliminating and focusing on what is being asked.

In the end of the meeting, we asked each member to think on what should be the game engine, features of the game, what will be the process flow and share their understanding in next meeting.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week all of us met for our very first meeting on Monday. We decided on how to proceed with the requirements and lay out the groundwork before proceeding further. As per the communication goes, we have setup decent communication channels which include biweekly meeting to discuss the agendas and project progress. We will be meeting every week to ensure proper communication amongst all the team members. In addition to this, we setup slack in order to communicate as well as keep up with the project deliverables.

All of us selected our respective agile values to focus on. I chose communication and will be focusing on achieving that value throughout the project. This week, I will be focusing on researching the project technology as per our weekly agenda.
  
**4. Respect - Junaid**

During our meetings as a team, every member respected every other member’s point of views. Everybody’s opinion was given the value that he/she deserved. Without respect, nobody can never succeed, and all team members worked on the base of this moto. During professional projects, many groups of people work on a project and play various roles, for example, management, developers, and customers or users, and everybody give respect and receive respect and this is how they successfully move forward and make progress in the right direction, and this is exactly the case in our situation. In our case, we as a team have adopted the roles of management, developers, and users, and have already discussed about how these roles will be played during our project, and discussed about how the factor of respect will hold its prominent place and guide us, so our project can succeed and can be finished within the allotted time frame.
  

**5. Courage - Junaid**

During first week of project, we met to set a path to follow during our project. we (team members) discussed about the project. We discussed about the core values of XP, the platform we will use for our project, discussed about creating a “user voice form”, defined the term “Done” for our backlog items, and about the choice of game engine to be used. All team members were fully motivated and participated very actively in the discussion, and courage was clearly visible throughout team’s research and discussion phase. Everyone in the team expressed his/her point of view, and provided valuable opinion during project selection. We discussed about the steps that we-as a team- will be jointly taking to make the success of our project certain. We talked about staying cling to reality during our project, and tell truth. We talked about conducting a courageous communication among team members where one should expect any sort of feedback about his/her work. No one should get upset based about the feedback he/she received, but rather consider the feedback to bring improvement to his/her work.

**6. See The Whole - Aartee**

Small modules in the project combine together to create the entire project. Each module would be implemented on different technology depending on the member implementing the module.

Combining all the modules and optimizing them to see it as a whole would need optimization of each unit of the project which includes ideas and their implementation. This would overall improve the whole project.

Since we started the project discussion with the group with a decent pace, we were able to picturize things by end of the week. Each one’s tasks were discussed with other members and after collecting feedback, we tried implementing that. Checking on everyone for completion of their intended tasks and discussing in case of any concerns so that we can always represent every work in a team as a whole.

## Week 2:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

In this week our team has shown the simplicity(XP core value) by deciding the simple game that can be played in any browser. While choosing amongst various games, we have focused on how the game can be kept simple so that it will be easy to play and have fun to the players.

Also, after deciding the Loopy Bird Game we gave our thought on how can we design the simple front-end for the customers. In that we all came to the conclusion of how all the screens will look like(title screen, game screen and game over screen). Henceforth, Simplicity is the key of our front-end and back-end design and development of the game.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, the meeting was held in the MLK Library where we finalized the open source game which we will be using. In the previous week we finalized the game engine that we will be using and settled to use melonJS. This week our aim was to finalize the game that we will build on melonJS. With the help of the big screen installed in the meeting rooms we explored the possible projects that can be implemented, thus eliminating wastage of time and energy where each member has to research separately. After finalizing the game we broke the game into sub-modules and assigned them to each member. We also discussed to expand the game by adding new difficulty levels to it which was not implemented before. We also downloaded the open source game and tried to run it locally.

During the whole meeting we tried to stay focus though there were times where we were going off topics. Not only the game which we are designing is based on divide and conquer technique, but also our day to day tasks are distributed in this fashion; thus, eliminating wastage of time, resources and energy.

**5. Courage - Junaid**

In the second week of our project development, we met to share our portions of work that we did, and to collaborate on the work we did individually. During this week, we not only finalized our research, we also have chosen the game we are going to work on. We discussed about how we are going to proceed and work on our game. We went over all the tutorials of melonJS, and decided to expand on the game called clumsy bird. All the team members provided their opinion about how we should proceed. Courage was visible during the team meetings since all members were explaining their design very calmly. They shared as well as incorporated their ideas. Beside this courage was visible due to the fact that members discussed about staying truly cling to reality regardless of the cost, and if some sort of situation arises that requires changes or modifications in our project, we should immediately adapt to get over that situation in order to make sure that we do not run in to more bumps ahead, and so that our project can flow smoothly towards the completion.

For our next meeting, we agreed on different roles to be played in agile development. New tasks about the project for the 2nd week were generated and allocated to team members. Shaiker was assigned the background audio and proper win and loss for the screen, Junaid was assigned themes for our game, Aartee was assigned the code, and Prathmesh was assigned the adding basic objects and obstacles to the game. Courage was seen in the team members, since everybody accepted the assigned task very happily. All team members informed about the time period required to finish the assigned task which was very courageous considering the fact that all team members are working on number of other projects for their other classes beside everybody is going to have mid-terms next week.
 

**6. See The Whole - Aartee**

This week each team member has learned the MelonJS by following the tutorial. Tutorial included development of two games(Space Invader and Platformer Tutorial).Everyone faced some issues initially like from where exactly start from, how to make local environment changes, how to install required packages, how to start the playing game locally, etc. But everyone is so helpful in the team so that both the tutorials are done and everyone now have the idea of MelonJS game engine.

To see the whole with respect to the project, we have done major tasks like deciding the game, its features, its high level implementation, its UI, etc. Overall, the team is now all set for implementing the game features.

## Week 3:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

Simplicity is the core of our game. In this week we have decided lots of features that needs to be implemented to keep the game simple for players like adding pause/resume functionality, giving option to select the difficulty level, etc.

We also discussed how the UI wireframes for the various screens of the game should be so that its development phase will be easy and simple.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, we discussed te UI wireframes, sequence diagrams and the activity diagrams so that we can get better understanding of our project. We also discussed various design patterns which we could implement in pur Project. We discueed what all complexeties could arrive in our project and we tried to eliminate them. Eliminate waste value has always been an integral part of our project.

**6. See The Whole - Aartee**

This week, every team has understood the MelonJS game engine by successfully completing the turorials and exploring it to the fullest. Also, team has decided additional features to be implemented in the game. Team, as a whole, has designed UI wireframes for various screens in our Loopy Bird Game.

As a whole, each team member is currently understanding the Github source code for the already existing clumsy bird game so that it will be easy to implement decided new features on top of that.
