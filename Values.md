# XP Values Journal

This document has been created to maintain a weekly journal entry to ensure that the Agile XP values are preserved during the implementation of this project.

## Week 1:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

Anything we create or develop is useful only if its understandable to everyone. Simplicity is hence key to all implementations. Complex thoughts and ideas can be broken into small units and simplified and implemented. This makes the content easy and comprehensive to interpret. 

This is the first week of the project and we have just begun discussing on the roles, task of each member, responsibilities, the technologies that can be used, alternate solutions, design and architecture and others. Whatever the idea may be, we shall put in effort to keep each unit simple and easy to interpret. 

The unnecessary elements need to be removed so that the necessary elements of the work get highlighted which involves the ability to simplify them. Simplicity leads to greater appreciation since it helps us to reduce the problem and uncover an innovation solution.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

The best way to eliminate waste is to do what is being asked and not more than that. Right from the starting our priority was to discard unwanted features and processes.

During the first week, we used the knowledge that was available within the team members and tried not to reinvent the wheel. We shared knowledge throughout the week in our meetings and Meeting Minutes were documented. We also created the task board and mentioned the backlog items.

We discussed to use open-source game engine as the aim of this project is to explore how Design patterns apply to project thus eliminating and focusing on what is being asked.

In the end of the meeting, we asked each member to think on what should be the game engine, features of the game, what will be the process flow and share their understanding in next meeting.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week all of us met for our very first meeting on Monday. We decided on how to proceed with the requirements and lay out the groundwork before proceeding further. As per the communication goes, we have setup decent communication channels which include biweekly meeting to discuss the agendas and project progress. We will be meeting every week to ensure proper communication amongst all the team members. In addition to this, we setup slack in order to communicate as well as keep up with the project deliverables.

All of us selected our respective agile values to focus on. I chose communication and will be focusing on achieving that value throughout the project. This week, I will be focusing on researching the project technology as per our weekly agenda.
  
**4. Respect - Junaid**

During our meetings as a team, every member respected every other member’s point of views. Everybody’s opinion was given the value that he/she deserved. Without respect, nobody can never succeed, and all team members worked on the base of this moto. During professional projects, many groups of people work on a project and play various roles, for example, management, developers, and customers or users, and everybody give respect and receive respect and this is how they successfully move forward and make progress in the right direction, and this is exactly the case in our situation. In our case, we as a team have adopted the roles of management, developers, and users, and have already discussed about how these roles will be played during our project, and discussed about how the factor of respect will hold its prominent place and guide us, so our project can succeed and can be finished within the allotted time frame.
  

**5. Courage - Junaid**

During first week of project, we met to set a path to follow during our project. we (team members) discussed about the project. We discussed about the core values of XP, the platform we will use for our project, discussed about creating a “user voice form”, defined the term “Done” for our backlog items, and about the choice of game engine to be used. All team members were fully motivated and participated very actively in the discussion, and courage was clearly visible throughout team’s research and discussion phase. Everyone in the team expressed his/her point of view, and provided valuable opinion during project selection. We discussed about the steps that we-as a team- will be jointly taking to make the success of our project certain. We talked about staying cling to reality during our project, and tell truth. We talked about conducting a courageous communication among team members where one should expect any sort of feedback about his/her work. No one should get upset based about the feedback he/she received, but rather consider the feedback to bring improvement to his/her work.

**6. See The Whole - Aartee**

Small modules in the project combine together to create the entire project. Each module would be implemented on different technology depending on the member implementing the module.

Combining all the modules and optimizing them to see it as a whole would need optimization of each unit of the project which includes ideas and their implementation. This would overall improve the whole project.

Since we started the project discussion with the group with a decent pace, we were able to picturize things by end of the week. Each one’s tasks were discussed with other members and after collecting feedback, we tried implementing that. Checking on everyone for completion of their intended tasks and discussing in case of any concerns so that we can always represent every work in a team as a whole.

## Week 2:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

In this week our team has shown the simplicity(XP core value) by deciding the simple game that can be played in any browser. While choosing amongst various games, we have focused on how the game can be kept simple so that it will be easy to play and have fun to the players.

Also, after deciding the Loopy Bird Game we gave our thought on how can we design the simple front-end for the customers. In that we all came to the conclusion of how all the screens will look like(title screen, game screen and game over screen). Henceforth, Simplicity is the key of our front-end and back-end design and development of the game.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, the meeting was held in the MLK Library where we finalized the open source game which we will be using. In the previous week we finalized the game engine that we will be using and settled to use melonJS. This week our aim was to finalize the game that we will build on melonJS. With the help of the big screen installed in the meeting rooms we explored the possible projects that can be implemented, thus eliminating wastage of time and energy where each member has to research separately. After finalizing the game we broke the game into sub-modules and assigned them to each member. We also discussed to expand the game by adding new difficulty levels to it which was not implemented before. We also downloaded the open source game and tried to run it locally.

During the whole meeting we tried to stay focus though there were times where we were going off topics. Not only the game which we are designing is based on divide and conquer technique, but also our day to day tasks are distributed in this fashion; thus, eliminating wastage of time, resources and energy.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week we met on Monday to discuss on how to proceed with the setup for running the melonJS tutorial. We also discussed if any team member is facing any issues with regards to the project setup. A meeting on Friday was set up to catch up on team progress and wrap up this week's tasks. The team finalized on the game and set up next week's tasks. It was ensured that proper communication channels being maintained for the team throughout the week.
  
**4. Courage - Junaid**

In the second week of our project development, we met to share our portions of work that we did, and to collaborate on the work we did individually. During this week, we not only finalized our research, we also have chosen the game we are going to work on. We discussed about how we are going to proceed and work on our game. We went over all the tutorials of melonJS, and decided to expand on the game called clumsy bird. All the team members provided their opinion about how we should proceed. Courage was visible during the team meetings since all members were explaining their design very calmly. They shared as well as incorporated their ideas. Beside this courage was visible due to the fact that members discussed about staying truly cling to reality regardless of the cost, and if some sort of situation arises that requires changes or modifications in our project, we should immediately adapt to get over that situation in order to make sure that we do not run in to more bumps ahead, and so that our project can flow smoothly towards the completion.

For our next meeting, we agreed on different roles to be played in agile development. New tasks about the project for the 2nd week were generated and allocated to team members. Shaiker was assigned the background audio and proper win and loss for the screen, Junaid was assigned themes for our game, Aartee was assigned the code, and Prathmesh was assigned the adding basic objects and obstacles to the game. Courage was seen in the team members, since everybody accepted the assigned task very happily. All team members informed about the time period required to finish the assigned task which was very courageous considering the fact that all team members are working on number of other projects for their other classes beside everybody is going to have mid-terms next week.
 

**5. See The Whole - Aartee**

This week each team member has learned the MelonJS by following the tutorial. Tutorial included development of two games(Space Invader and Platformer Tutorial).Everyone faced some issues initially like from where exactly start from, how to make local environment changes, how to install required packages, how to start the playing game locally, etc. But everyone is so helpful in the team so that both the tutorials are done and everyone now have the idea of MelonJS game engine.

To see the whole with respect to the project, we have done major tasks like deciding the game, its features, its high level implementation, its UI, etc. Overall, the team is now all set for implementing the game features.

## Week 3:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

Simplicity is the core of our game. In this week we have decided lots of features that needs to be implemented to keep the game simple for players like adding pause/resume functionality, giving option to select the difficulty level, etc.

We also discussed how the UI wireframes for the various screens of the game should be so that its development phase will be easy and simple.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, we discussed te UI wireframes, sequence diagrams and the activity diagrams so that we can get better understanding of our project. We also discussed various design patterns which we could implement in pur Project. We discueed what all complexeties could arrive in our project and we tried to eliminate them. Eliminate waste value has always been an integral part of our project.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week we all met and discussed on game levels to be implemented. A discussion happened on designing UI wireframes for each of the game screens. Active participation was ensured throughout the discussion and each member suggested their ideas which can be implemented at various levels in the clumsy bird game.

**4. Courage - Junaid**

During the 3rd week of our project development, we finalized our research work. We have completed the tutorials of MelonJs, and team members discussed and agreed on the way forward. As a team, we analyzed the already available source code of clumsy birds, and we researched a bit deeper on that code to find out how can we expand on the currently available game. How can we use different designer patterns and how we can add additional features to the current game (expansion process). Courage was visible during all these activities since no team member hesitated to share his/her point of view and accepted their tasks that were assigned to them very happily.

In the next week we already have decided about how we will proceed, and carry on our assigned part of work. Artee will work on code, Shaiker will work on adding audio to the game, Prathmesh will work on the sequence and activity diagram, Junaid (I) will work on the loading screen where I will add themes to the game, and also will work on the bird movement. Every team member is fully motivated and courageous to get all these task by the end of next week.

**5. See The Whole - Aartee**

This week, every team has understood the MelonJS game engine by successfully completing the turorials and exploring it to the fullest. Also, team has decided additional features to be implemented in the game. Team, as a whole, has designed UI wireframes for various screens in our Loopy Bird Game.

As a whole, each team member is currently understanding the Github source code for the already existing clumsy bird game so that it will be easy to implement decided new features on top of that.

**6. Respect - Junaid**

During our meetings as a team this week, we all worked together collaboratively, and shared our reserach work with one another, and asked our team members if any further improvement is needed in the work that whe have done/completed so far. Members reviewed the peers work, and provided their opinion. Factor of respect was clearly visible during communication among team members since every member's request was heard and full attention was paid by every other team member, and appropraite response was provided for the request.

## Week 4:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

In this week we have customized the clumsy bird game to the loopy bird game by adding simple background, ground tile, title screen, etc. We have understood the melonJS code for the game by simply dividing code to everyone. So that one can focused on specific part and becomes easy to understand at first. Later everyone has explained the code to everyone. This is how our team has shown simplicity by following divide and conquer method.

In this week each member has explored the code thoroughly by implementing the simplicity core value.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, we discussed and made changes to the existing game. We studied the implemented classes and worked through the flow. After understanding the flow of the game we made changes and tried to enhance the game. The modified images were taken from open source.  We tried to stick to the basic plan of scrum thus eliminating waste by saving time and energy.  

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week we discussed on the pending issues and how we'll be moving forward. We decided on pur theme of the game and the game entities. We are going to make winter/ice based theme with white background. All members participated actively and proper communication was maintained. We picked some tasks and assigned it to ourselves and will be working on it through the enxt week.

**4. Courage - Junaid**

During week 4 of our project, everybody seemed extremely courageous since the planned task were completed on time, and not late. Team was satisfied that all the scheduled tasks assigned to each team member were completed on time, and every team member is fully honoring the responsibilities assigned to him/her. Everybody in the team was happy to see that progress is being made in the right direction. During our this meeting, we planned the tasks for the 2nd phase of our project which is going to start next week.  Every team member was assigned the task to work on. I was assigned to design logo for the game, and understand the melonJS engine functions, and to shortlist the design patterns that we will implement in our project.

**5. See The Whole - Aartee**

Everyone now has the clear understanding of the features of the game and how to proceed with its implementation in the MelonJS engine.

As a whole, in this week each team member has explored the existing clumsy bird source code thoroughly so that it will be easy to enhance and add new features on top of that. Also, everyone has given there ideas while customizing the game so that it will be simple and fun to play the game.

**6. Respect - Junaid**

This week, we worked together and customized the clumsy bird game to loopy bird game. We shared our ideas with one another, and obtained the opinion of our team members regarding any further improvement. All members individually reviewed the work that we have completed so far, and provided their valuable opinions. Respect was clearly visible during opinion provision, and ideas sharing phase of our project.

## Week 5:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

Scrum week has started from this week. We have decided to meet everyday to discuss the progress of the work, any problems while working, etc. We have kept working style simple such that everyone will work on separate feature of the game but with the collaboration with every other team members. By doing this it is easy to incraese the velocity of the work towards game as well as its not the complicate thing to focus on one feature at a time.

In this week each member has worked on differnt features of the game by implementing the simplicity core value.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week the scrum methodology was started and for that we decided to have daily stand up meetings to dscuss about each other progress.
The code and the features have been finalized and we started hands on on our coding.For the upcomings weeks our aim is to focus on the design patterns that can be  mlemented in the game and start implementing them.

The Eliminate waste core value was always kept in mind while building the project.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week we all met and discused on the code implementation. Each team member took specific gamne modules to develop. From now on, we will focus on working code delivery every week and will be going with the scrum approach. Proper communication was maintained throughout the team by organizing weekly meetings, communicating via emails etc. 

**4. Courage - Junaid**

This week we met on regular basis to discuss the work among team members, and to plan how to proceed during the scrum phase of our project. Aspect of courage was clearly visible in the fact that all team members seemed completely ready to move forward, and collaborate with one another. Team members are working on various features of the game in collaboration with one another. The important aspect that is most prominently visible in this team work is that each team member clearly communicate and discuss his /her task with other team members to get the opinion of other members.

**5. See The Whole - Aartee**

Everyone now has the clear understanding of the features of the game and how to proceed with its implementation in the MelonJS engine.

As a whole, in this week each team member has written the javascript code for various basic features of the game. Also, everyone has researched on design patterns that can be implemented in the game.

**6. Respect - Junaid**

This week, scrum phase of our project started, and we have started working on the code for our game. All team members discussed and provided their opinion about how to proceed and how to handle issues if one pops-up.  Respect among team members was clearly visible during the discussion about writing the code for game, and team members discussed about the expectations of users. User’s expectations were considered with all due respect, and will be considered in future too during the developmental phase of game.

## Week 6:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

This week everyone has implemented desgin patterns in the game. While writing the code evryone has made sure that the code is maintable, reusable and simple to understand others. Also while coding we have made the class/interface structure simple enough so that it will be easy to integrate the class diagram for the whole game.

Hence, in this week each member has implemented design patterns in the game by implementing the simplicity core value.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week the target was to implement the design patterns in the game. While coding we implemented Design patterns that we learned in the lectures thus saving time to learn them again. The main challenge was to decide where and when which design pattern should be implemented. While coding we always keep out core value in mind.  

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week we decided on design patterns to implement in our age. We all met for the meeting and each member chose certain patterns that he/she is going to implement. Besides this, each member suggested which game features he/she wants to implement. Proper communication was observed throughout the week.

**4. Courage - Junaid**

Team meetings during this week consists of discussion about the code that we developed and the design patterns that we implemented. We discussed about the dynamics of our code. Our code is reusable and very easy to maintain. Each team member analyzed the code to check if any improvement is possible, and provided his/her valuable opinion about the code. 

**5. See The Whole - Aartee**

As a whole in this week everyone has implemented various design patterns in the game. While brainstorming on the design patterns everyone has made sure that the ingration of code will be easy and simple to understand. Also, thought on how to create the class diagram is given by everyone.

**6. Respect - Junaid**

The week we met to discuss about the design patterns we will implement in our game. Each member provided his/her point of view about the task, and each team member selected 2 design patterns for implementation. Factor of respect was clearly visible throughout the team discussion among all team members, and respect was equally considered while thinking about the users of game. 


## Week 7:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**

This week also everyone has brainstormed and implemented desgin patterns in the game. While writing the code evryone has made sure that the code is maintable, reusable and simple to understand for others. Also while coding we have made the class/interface structure simple enough so that it will be easy to integrate the class diagram for the whole game.

Hence, in this week each member has implemented design patterns in the game by adapting the simplicity core value.

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, we continued with the design patterns and tried to study which design pattern can be implemented. We also added new functionalities to our code like pause and full screen. Our main focus is now to implement design patterns to the game and for that we are researching on design patterns implemented in javascript as our code is in javascript, thus eliminating waste. We always try to keep the core values in mind while coding.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**

This week we all met and finalized the features along with the design patterns we are implementing. In the next week, we will be focusing on UML diagrams. Every team member participated in the meeting and put his/her points in the meeting. Proper communication was maintained throughout the week.

**4. Courage -  Junaid**

Most of this week’s discussion revolved around the various additional design patterns that can be implemented on our game. In addition to design patterns, we also talked about the additional modifications that can be made to the work that we have completed so far on our game. We discussed about those modifications, and every team member courageously gave his/her opinion about how we can implement those modifications, and how those modifications will increase the interest of users in our game.

**5. See The Whole - Aartee**

Everyone now has the clear understanding of the features of the game and how to proceed with its implementation by following the design patterns in the MelonJS engine.

As a whole, in this week each team member has written the javascript code by implementing the design patterns in thr game. Also, everyone has started crating various UML diagrams for the game.

**6. Respect -  Junaid**

During this week, all team members respectfully discussed about the further improvements that can be made to our game by implementing additional design patterns. Team members took in to account the users of our game, and put themselves in to the user’s shoes to better analyze interests of users, and discussed about the features that if we add will increase the interest of users in our game. Every team member provided his/her opinion about bringing improvements to our game, and all team members respected the viewpoint of one another.


## Week 8:

**1. Simplicty - Aartee**


**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

This week, our main aim was to stabilize the game so that, if last minute changes occurred we could handle them. We are trying to implement new levels in this game. We also are trying to implement various design patterns. We all have our weekly meeting regularly and everyone contributes equally. We all keep the core values in mind while working on the project and this has greatly helped us in the project progress and development.

**3. Communication - Shikhar**


**4. Courage -  Junaid**

Our main goal for this week was to wrap up things, and all team members spent some extra time on moving things towards the final destination. All team members worked extremely courageouly and hard to make this possible. The reason we wanted to wrap up different phases of our project earlier is that if the need for changes arise, we should have enough time to work on those changes. Currently, we are also working on the implementation of various design patterns that we chose last week for implementation.
