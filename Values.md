# XP Values Journal

This document has been created to maintain a weekly journal entry to ensure that the Agile XP values are preserved during the implementation of this project.

## Week 1:

**1. Simplicty**

**2. Eliminate Waste - Prathmesh**

The best way to eliminate waste is to do what is being asked and not more than that. Right from the starting our priority was to discard unwanted features and processes.

During the first week, we used the knowledge that was available within the team members and tried not to reinvent the wheel. We shared knowledge throughout the week in our meetings and Meeting Minutes were documented. We also created the task board and mentioned the backlog items.

We discussed to use open-source game engine as the aim of this project is to explore how Design patterns apply to project thus eliminating and focusing on what is being asked.

In the end of the meeting, we asked each member to think on what should be the game engine, features of the game, what will be the process flow and share their understanding in next meeting.

## Week 2:

**1. Simplicty**

<Make an entry here>

**2. Eliminate Waste**

This week, the meeting was held in the MLK Library where we finalized the open source game which we will be using. In the previous week we finalized the game engine that we will be using and settled to use melonJS. This week our aim was to finalize the game that we will build on melonJS. With the help of the big screen installed in the meeting rooms we explored the possible projects that can be implemented, thus eliminating wastage of time and energy where each member has to research separately. After finalizing the game we broke the game into sub-modules and assigned them to each member. We also discussed to expand the game by adding new difficulty levels to it which was not implemented before. We also downloaded the open source game and tried to run it locally.

During the whole meeting we tried to stay focus though there were times where we were going off topics. Not only the game which we are designing is based on divide and conquer technique, but also our day to day tasks are distributed in this fashion; thus, eliminating wastage of time, resources and energy.
