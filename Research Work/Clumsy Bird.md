## History

Clumsy Bird is a simple clone of the famous Flappy Bird. It was simple 2 day project that could build something that 
can help a lot of people to start making games. The game was made with a fabulous game framework called MelonJS. The game 
developer's prior motivation wasto make this project was to show to game developers aspirants that they didnâ€™t need to 
spend hundreds of dollars buying pre-made game clones.
