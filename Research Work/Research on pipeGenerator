After understanding the flow of pipeGenerator here is how it works:

1. We initialize by giving the actual pipe size and the hole size of the pipe. 
2. Then a random function is used to find the size of pipe each time in the game.
3. Two pipes are taken one for top and one for bottom. 
4. One of the pipe is inverted for the top.
