In object-oriented programming, objects do the work they advertise through their interface (properties and methods).
Clients of these objects expect this work to be done quickly and efficiently. However, there are situations where an object is severely
constrained and cannot live up to its responsibility. Typically this occurs when there is a dependency on a remote resource (resulting
in network latency) or when an object takes a long time to load.
