### Modular Design Pattern

We have used Modular Design Pattern as we are uing Javascript for developing the game. In each of the js files we have implemented Modular
Design Pattern. In JavaScript modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of 
other components. This provides loose coupling to support well-structured code. 

### Play.js

### gameover.js

Here we have declared the var vol inside the function so that it cannot be accessed by outside object. It can only be accessed by variables 
within its original scope.

This will provide loose coupling to support well-structured code.
