### Prototype Design Pattern

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with
values it copied from a prototype - or sample - object. The Prototype pattern is also referred to as the Properties pattern.

The prototype model is used mainly for creating objects in performance-intensive situations. The objects created are clones 
(shallow clones) of the original object that are passed around.
