**Agenda**

    1. We had a discussion about wrapping things up since we already entered the last week of our project, 
    and we set a goal to finish the tasks that are in progress.
    2. We set a goal to complete the implementation of additional design patterns that we chose last week, 
    and are currently implementing on our game.
    3. We set the goal to complete the implementation of new levels in our game (an important improvement).

**Minutes**

   1. We discussed and finalized the procedure about getting done with the task that are currently in progress.
   2. All team members agreed to the immediate completion of implementation of new design patterns 
   that we chose last week, so we can check and run our game before class demo.
   3. Team discussed and agreed about creating new levels in the game.
   4. We updated XP core values on wiki for week 8.
   
**Actions**

    1. We worked on and completed some additional designer patterns that we chose for implementation. 
    2. We updated the task board, closed all the open issues that we completed, and moved some newly
    created ones to “ready to start”.
    3. All team members updated burndown chart, and core values.
    4. All team members analyzed the project as a whole to see if there is any module that demands 
    further improvement. We came up with some possible improvements.

**TO DO**

    1. To Write code for adding new features to our game, and also to write code for some of remaining
    design patterns that are being implemented on our game.
    2. To complete the UML class diagrams for the some additional design patterns that we chose, and are
    currently in progress.
